<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, 

  My name is Vasiliki Loli and I am currently 23 years old.
  I just finished my Computer Science Degree in Ionian University,
  Corfu, with a major in Computer Science in the field of Human Sciences.
  After getting this degree, I aspire to extend my studies by getting a 
  Master's Degree in the field of Game Development.

  My top hobbies list consists of:
  <ul>
    <li>Music</li>
    <li>Drawing</li>
    <li>Going on long car adventures</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  As a person, I try to contribute in voluntary work as much as
  I can. Recently, I participated as a volunteer at my university's 
  booth in the 8th Thessaloniki International Fair. Voluntary work is 
  really important and you can gather many different experiences through
  it.
